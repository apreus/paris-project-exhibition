selection: Which Ingres portrait?
caption: J. A. D. Ingres (1780-1867) is best known today for his neoclassical paintings,
  but he also completed several commissioned portraits in the late years of his career.
  A hypothetical Ingres portrait of Mme Jacquemart-Andr√© might resemble his 1845
  Portrait of Comtesse d'Haussonville, held by the  Frick Collection.
