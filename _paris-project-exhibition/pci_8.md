  of Paris. This photograph of the Place de la Concorde was taken from the Pont de
  la Concorde with the Luxor Ob√©lisque visible in the background, c.1906-7.  [During
  the French Revolution the Place de la Concorde was renamed Place de la R√©volution,
  and Louis XVI was famously executed there in 1793.]
