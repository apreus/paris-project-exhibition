caption: The Bois de Boulogne is a large public park on the Western edge of Paris's
  city limits. Formerly royal property, Napoleon III and Baron Haussman transformed
  the land into a center for leisure as part of a massive urban renewal program in
  the 1850s. This aerial photo depicts the Bois de Boulogne with the Seine in the
  background, c.1853 ‚Äì70.
