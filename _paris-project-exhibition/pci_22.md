notes: Edouard Manet, Olympia 1863. Currently in the Mus√©e d'Orsay (founded 1986)--I
  know that a lot of the impressionist painting currently at the Orsay bounced around
  a lot between the Mus√©e de Luxembourg, the Jeu de Paume, and I guess the Louvre
  since HM names it here. Could do more research to confirm.
