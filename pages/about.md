**About the Digital Edition**   

Like so many modernist texts, Hope Mirrlees’s Paris: A Poem is not easy to read. Written during 1919 and published in a print run of 175 copies by Leonard and Virginia Woolf’s Hogarth Press in 1920, Paris is a formally experimental depiction of a woman’s movement across the postwar City of Lights over the course of a single day. Set during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, it is a poem that requires us to see and hear as we read: it is full of period-specific imagery (advertisements, street signs, posters in a Metro station), sounds (bits of conversation, several bars of music), and architectural references, and several sections incorporate the techniques of concrete poetry.[1] Virginia Woolf, who typeset the poem, called it “obscure, indecent and brilliant.”[2] And the late Julia Briggs, who introduced and provided a foundational set of scholarly annotations to the poem in Bonnie Kime Scott’s Gender in Modernism (2007), declared it a “lost modernist masterpiece.”[3] Since the publication of Briggs’s annotations and, more recently, Sandeep Parmar’s edition of Mirrlees’s Collected Poems (2011), scholarly attention to Mirrlees has grown steadily. Yet our ability to teach Mirrlees in courses on modernist studies remains somewhat limited: nearly everything she wrote is out of print, and unlike, say, T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land, to which Paris is frequently compared and which was repackaged as a digital edition via Touch Press in 2011, there has not yet appeared “an app for that” that would make Mirrlees’s poem seem approachable—even, if you’ll forgive us, relatable—to contemporary students. Four years ago, with the explicit understanding that adaptation can enable more attentive reading practices in our classrooms, we set out to change that. Working with a team of faculty, staff, and students in the Humanities Digital Workshop at Washington University in St. Louis, we began the process of creating a digital edition of Mirrlees’s Paris—a project that, like the poem itself, has turned out to be vastly more complicated than we had initially thought...
