__The Paris Project__ is a digital edition of Hope Mirrlees's groundbreaking modernist long poem, <em>Paris</em>. The first edition of the poem was hand-printed by Virginia Woolf and published in 1920 by her Hogarth Press. A century later, this digital edition presents a diplomatic transcription of the original text alongside scholarly notes, contemporary images, and contextual essays.
