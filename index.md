__The Paris Project__ is a digital edition of Hope Mirrlees's groundbreaking modernist long poem, *Paris*. The first edition of the poem was hand-printed by Virginia Woolf and published in 1920 by the Hogarth Press. A century later this digital edition, edited by Melanie Micir and Anna Preus, presents a diplomatic transcription of the original text alongside scholarly notes by Julia Briggs, contemporary images, and contextual essays.
